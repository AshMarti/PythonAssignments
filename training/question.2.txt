Question 2
In order to increase precision, I needed to create more true positive (TP) training instances until the amount of TP data divided by the sum of all the positive instances (including false positive instances) equalled 0.9. Adding positive instances about dogs that incorporated the positive features increased my precision, but it also increased my accuracy. In order to decrease accuracy to below 0.65, I created flase negative trianing data (positive instances that did not have the positive feature words in them.) This caused my accuracy to decrease. In total, I added 29 new TP instances (for example: "I love my dog" has positive feature "dog") and 23 new false negative training instanes (for example: "Dalmations have lots of spots" is a positive statement talking about a breed of dog, but does not contain any positive features).
