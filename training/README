This exercise has three tasks:
TASK 1:
	The file new.training.txt contains training data that can be 
	analyzed using ooclassifierbasev3.py. It uses the topic of
	dogs, and provides positive features than can be used to 
	indentify positive instances in the data. The file has
	true positive, true negative,, false positive, and false 
	negative instances. It can be run using the terminal command:
	  $ python3 ooclassifierbasev3.py new.training.txt
TASK 2:
	The file question.1.txt contains a written response discussing 
	the process and strategy of creating new.training.txt.
TASK 3:
	The file task.3.txt is similar to new.training.txt except with
	a total of 52 new positive training instances to increase
	precision and decrease accuracy of the classifer. It can be run
	using the terminal command:
	  $ python3 ooclassifierbasev3.py task.3.txt
	A second file was also created for this task. The file
	question.2.txt contains a written response discussing the process
	and strategy of creating task.3.txt from new.training.txt
